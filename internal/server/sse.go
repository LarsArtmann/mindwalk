// without periodic traffic, reverse proxies (nginx, Cloudflare) may drop the

// when an evaluation is running and receives "progress" events (one per
// judge milestone) followed by a terminal "status" event carrying the same
// reportStatus the polling endpoint returns. If no job is running, the
// handler sends just the "status" event and closes.
//
// Each progress event carries an SSE "id:" line so the browser's EventSource
// tracks the last received event and sends it back as Last-Event-ID on
// reconnect. This lets a dropped connection resume from where it left off
// instead of replaying from the beginning.
